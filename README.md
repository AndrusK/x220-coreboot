This is my build of coreboot for the Thinkpad X220.
Nothing super special here, uses edk2 as a payload.
I didn't care enough to set a bootsplash, but that can be added later with cbfstool if you happen to care.
My build has the ME stripped out, however if you need the ME you can use my config file and make the appropriate changes.
In the deconstructed_rom folder, you'll find the Descriptor, BIOS, ME, and GBE regions of the ROM labeled original_X220.rom
