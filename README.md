This is my build of coreboot for the Thinkpad X220.<br>
Nothing super special here, uses edk2 as a payload.<br>
I didn't care enough to set a bootsplash, but that can be added later with cbfstool if you happen to care.<br>
My build has the ME stripped out, however if you need the ME you can use my config file and make the appropriate changes.<br>
In the deconstructed_rom folder, you'll find the Descriptor, BIOS, ME, and GBE regions of the ROM labeled original_X220.rom<br>
